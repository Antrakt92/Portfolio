### Geopolitical Factors

## 🎲 Investment Strategy

### Pre-Crisis DCA (Current): €100/month

| Asset | Monthly € | % |
|-------|-----------|---|

| XDWT | €10 | 10% |
| 10AF | €8 | 8% |
| LYP6 | €7 | 7% |

**Rationale:**
- **Small DCA:** CAPE at 40 = extreme overvaluation

- **Accumulating cash:** Target €60k emergency fund (15 months)
- **Crisis preparation:** Reserve €10-15k for deployment at S&P -30%+

### Emergency Fund Strategy

**Current:** €48,000 (12 months expenses)
**Target:** €60,000 (15 months expenses)

**Purpose:**

## 🚨 Crisis Response Plan

### Trigger Levels (S&P 500 currently ~6,900)

| Correction | S&P Level | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **-15% to -25%** | 5,175-5,865 | Double DCA to €200-400/month |
| **-25% to -40%** | 4,140-5,175 | Deploy €10k + €600-1,000/month DCA |
| **-40% to -60%** | <4,140 | Maximum deployment + shift allocation |

### Post-Crisis Allocation (3 Options)

| 10AF | 10% |
| LYP6 | 8% |
| **Gold** | 5% |
| ERNX | 3% |

| XDWT | 11% |
| 10AF | 10% |

## 🔄 Bond Rebalancing Strategy

### Critical Understanding: Bonds Rally During Crisis ✅

**Historical Performance:**
- **2008 Crisis:** Stocks -57%, Bonds **+5-8%** ✅
- **2020 COVID:** Stocks -34%, Bonds **+8-12%** ✅

**Mechanism:**
1. Fed cuts rates → Bond prices rise
2. Flight to safety → Demand for bonds increases
3. Bonds become expensive exactly when stocks are cheap

### Current Bond Position

**Status:** €914.70 (36.6% of portfolio)
**Performance:** +0.30% (rates haven't dropped yet)
**Assessment:** "Loaded spring" ready to rally in crisis

### Rebalancing Execution (When S&P Reaches -40%)

**Day 1 Deployment:**

1. **Sell bonds:** €520 (keep €390 = 3% of new portfolio)
2. **Expected proceeds:** €560-620 (bonds rally +10-15% during crisis)
3. **Deploy emergency fund:** €10,000
4. **Total deployment:** €10,540-10,600

**Distribution** (Option B - With BTC):
- €6,100 → SPYI (58%)
- €1,160 → XDWT (11%)
- €1,050 → BTC (10%, only if at $30-50k)
- €1,050 → 10AF (10%)
- €840 → LYP6 (8%)
- €320 → ERNX (3%)

**Months 2-12:**
- Aggressive DCA: €600-1,000/month
- Follow post-crisis allocation percentages
- No additional bond purchases

## 💡 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Currency Risk Is Real
- ❌ **USD Bonds (QDV4):** -7.65% loss due to FX drag
- ✅ **EUR Bonds (ERNX):** +0.30% stable
- **Rule:** Bonds MUST be in base currency; stocks can be any currency

### 2. Sunk Cost Fallacy
Sold QDV4 at -7.65% loss - correct decision:
- Small loss today < (small loss + years of opportunity cost)
- Stopped bleeding, redirected to better asset

### 3. Dollar Decline Accelerating
- US debt unsustainable
- Central banks buying gold at record levels (+66% in 2025)
- BRICS de-dollarization underway
- Dollar down 6-10% in 2025 (worst since 2017)
- **Protection:** ~47% US exposure (vs 70% standard portfolio)

### 4. Index Funds > Active Management
- Private equity: 90% underperform S&P 500
- Hedge funds: 4-6% fees, poor returns
- Your ETFs: 0.07-0.25% TER, outperform 90% active managers

### 5. Emergency Fund = Competitive Advantage
€48k (12 months) enables:
- Aggressive investing without liquidity risk
- €10-15k deployment capacity during crisis
- Peace of mind during market volatility

### 6. Gold Breakout Confirmed
- October 2025: $4,300 (considered expensive)
- January 2026: $4,460 (+66% for 2025, best since 1979)
- **Assessment:** Structural bull market confirmed, but entry point missed
- **Strategy:** Wait for crisis pullback (-15-20%) or use BTC as alternative

### 7. Recession Timing Is Hard
- October 2025: Expected recession Q4 2025-Q2 2026
- January 2026: Recession delayed but not cancelled
- **Lesson:** Don't try to time exactly, maintain dry powder
